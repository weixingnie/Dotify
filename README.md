# INFO448HW3 Dotify Project by Oliver Nie
This is a simple music app for people to play music. It would provide
the song's name, artist, album art, media control buttons from the package
provided. It uses recycleview to allow user to click and scroll down as long
as they want. Once user clicks on the song, it would have a miniplayer. If the
user want to dive deeper to the selected song, they can clicks on the miniplayer and
they can jump to the actual music player.

Now, we are adding functions to allow user to watch/
listen to music on wide screen(horizontal orientation).
Also, we are adding multiple fragments so you could dive deeper into the knowledge of a particular song.

# Extra Credit
I have completed extra credit No.1 you could retreat back to the main setting fragments from about, statistic, and profile.
